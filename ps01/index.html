    <p>Hello my name is Kuan-Ting Lin. I have a degree in Architectural Engineering from Kansas State University. Currently I am in a three-year M.Arch. Iïœ‚ like Architecture. I am also interested in sustainble designs and related topics.
        What is sustainability? It is a complex concept that means living within the resources of the planet without damaging the environment now or in the future. For Example, windmills and solar panels use renewable energy instead of traditional energy, such as oil and coal.
        Sustainable design is one of the topics that I currently am really interested in and hope to know more. We only have one earth. I would like to research and study more about how to sustain our earth.</p>
